The smaller the N the sharper the peaks of the R waves, making it easier 
to detect them and making the signal smoother. 

When the peak of the R wave begins to have fluctuations (not sharp), that means
the N needs to be decreased. 

Also, a very small N will make the R waves look like lines, making the flow of 
the signal disappear. 

In our signal dataN.txt, N = 25 gave a smooth signal with good sharps.
